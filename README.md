# simb3-embedded-code
This is a repo for the Arduino embedded control code for SIMB3. 

Updated 26 January 2022
The current production code is SIMB3_BRAIN_V4.ino. This is code for V4 SIMB3s using the custom one-wire temperature string. 
Note: code for the SIMB3 one-wire temperature string is in a separate repo (simb3-temp-string)
